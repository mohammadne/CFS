# Compose

Docker Compose is the developer’s orchestration tool for running multi-container applications locally.

It lets you define services, networks, volumes, and configs in a single declarative YAML file.

## Compose File Structure (compose.yml)

Key top-level objects:

- services
- volumes
- networks
- configs
- secrets

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environments:
        PASSWORD: ${STRONG_PASSWORD} # read from .env file

  db:
    image: postgres:16
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    secrets:
      - db_pass

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine

volumes:
  pgdata:

secrets:
  db_pass:
    file: ./secrets/db_pass.txt
```

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
