## Building Production-Ready Dockerfiles

### Slim base images

Using smaller base images reduces:

- Attack surface
- Build time
- Network transfer size

A slim image is a version of a base image that:

- Contains only the minimal OS packages needed to run the language/runtime
- Removes documentation, locales, compilers, man pages
- Does NOT include build tools (gcc, make, git, curl, etc.)
- Results in a much smaller image size

```txt
| Image                | Size                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `python:3.12`        | ~940 MB                                          |
| `python:3.12-slim`   | ~80–90 MB                                        |
| `python:3.12-alpine` | ~10–15 MB *(but musl-based, can break binaries)* |
```

```dockerfile
# bad
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3

# good
FROM python:3.12-slim

# even better
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3
```

Why “slim”?

- Fewer packages → fewer vulnerabilities
- Faster image pulls
- Smaller cache footprint

Why not always Alpine?

- Alpine uses musl libc, not glibc
- Some Python, Java, Go, C binaries behave differently

### Non-root users

Running as root increases risk:

- Container escape attacks
- Privilege escalation
- Volume write abuse

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
RUN useradd -m app
USER app
```

### Multi-stage builds

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.25.4
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o app
CMD ["./app"]
```

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:1.25.4 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o app

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM alpine:3.19
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/app .
CMD ["./app"]
```

### Pinning versions

- Reproducible builds
- Predictable deployment
- Stable releases

```dockerfile
# bad
RUN apt-get install -y nginx

# good
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx=1.18.0-6ubuntu14.4
```

### Reducing attack surface

remove everything your app does not need

- Remove package manager caches
- Use distroless images (no shell, no package manager)
- Reduce Linux capabilities
- Disable root login
- Read-only filesystem
- Remove build tools in production (golang, curl, gcc, git)
- Don't copy the entire repo if unnecessary

### Full Example

```txt
# requirements.txt
flask==3.0.2
```

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM python:3.12-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app

# Install build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

# Stage 2: Run
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app .

# Drop privileges
USER nonroot

ENTRYPOINT ["app.py"]
```

## Dockerfile Best Practices

### Environment variables and ARGs

ARG -> build time -> Common for versions, build flags
ENV -> Available at runtime -> Used by your application

### Layer ordering for caching

- cache breaks too early

```dockerfile
COPY . .
RUN npm install
```

- Only the last COPY breaks cache

```dockerfile
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .
```

### Structuring RUN commands

- Creates too many layers

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN apt-get install -y git
RUN apt-get clean
```

- Smaller image
- Faster build
- Fewer layers → better caching

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl git && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### Using .dockerignore

reduces build context size

Without .dockerignore, `COPY . .` will break caching even if you change only README.md

```.dockerignore
.git
node_modules
.env
*.log
__pycache__
build/
dist/
docker-compose.yml
README.md
```

### Dockerfile commands & Best practices

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20.11-slim AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# 1. Only copy files that impact installs
COPY package*.json ./

# 2. Install dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# 3. Copy rest of files
COPY . .

# Runtime stage
FROM node:20.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# 4. Non-root user
RUN useradd -m app
USER app

# 5. Copy app from builder
COPY --from=builder /app .

# 6. Environmental variables
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=8080

EXPOSE 8080

# 7. Entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "index.js"]
```

## Docker BuildKit vs Classic Builder

Docker originally used a classic (legacy) builder, which was simple but slow and limited.
BuildKit is the next-generation build engine introduced to solve these limitations.

Think of it like this:

- Classic Builder = old single-threaded compiler
- BuildKit = modern parallel, cached, secure build system
