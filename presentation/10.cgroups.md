# CGroups

Cgroups (Control Groups) are a Linux kernel feature that allows you to:

1. Limit resources for processes -> CPU, memory, PIDs, I/O bandwidth, etc.

2. Isolate resources for groups of processes -> Processes in one cgroup cannot interfere with others

3. Account usage of resources -> Track how much CPU, memory, or I/O a group of processes consumes

## Cgroups v1 vs v2

v1: separate hierarchies for each resource controller (CPU, memory, PIDs…)

v2: unified hierarchy — simpler and more consistent
