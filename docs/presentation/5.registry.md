# Registry

## Public vs Private

A container registry is simply a hosted storage system for container images.
Think of it like GitHub but for Docker images.

You push images to it, others pull from it.

Registries can be:

- Public → anyone can pull your image (e.g., nginx:latest)
- Private → requires authentication (companies, internal systems)

- Docker Hub
- GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- AWS ECR

Most widely used self-hosted registry is Harbor
